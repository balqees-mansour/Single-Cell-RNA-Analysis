## Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq (Reproducability)
### Abstract :

To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied
single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients,
profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the
same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial
context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells
from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of
the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the
AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns,
including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion
programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability
across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-
cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.
