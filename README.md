# Single-Cell-RNA-seq Analysis
Reproduce two data analyses using the single cell RNA-seq data of the following study: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0501

In order to investigate the diverse genetic and physical characteristics of melanoma tumors, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 4645 individual cells taken from 17 patients. This sequencing analyzed malignant cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells and uncovered transcriptional diversity among the malignant cells within the same tumor, which was linked to factors such as the cell cycle, local environment, and resistance to drugs.
